    aboutMeDetailed: `The son of a nuclear physicist, Allen Snow was raised in the historic small-town of Oak Ridge, Tennessee ('The Atomic City'), after which he attended Auburn University where he obtained a bachelor's degree in civil engineering, unique amongst REALTORS®. While working as an engineer for 10 years before switching to real estate sales in 2001, Allen spent time in many areas of the country including cities such as Atlanta, Boston, Fort Lauderdale, Memphis, Miami, Raleigh, Providence and San Francisco. Each time Allen visited Atlanta, he felt a deep connection to the City where he ultimately found both business and personal success. Allen has now resided in Midtown for over 17 years where he enjoys the outdoors in Piedmont Park, bikes the Atlanta BeltLine, and embraces the diverse culture and fantastic local cuisine. Allen's pride, passion and enthusiasm for the city of Atlanta is reflected in his successful real estate business. 'Every time I open the Atlanta Business Chronicle, an exciting new project is being planned, and I love sharing that information with my clients and getting them as excited about it as I am,' Allen says.

Since 2001, the year Allen decided to delve into real estate sales full time, he began earning notable awards such as 'Rookie of the Year,' 'Agent of the Year' nearly every year, ranking in the top 1% among 50,000 real estate agents internationally, and ranking No. 3 in Metro Atlanta New Home Sales category in 2014. Currently, he is on track to meet or exceed these same goals for 2015. Allen owes his success to loving what he does, building relationships and working well with people.

It was with Allen's degree and 10 years of experience in civil engineering that his interest and insight in real estate sales and real estate development grew and he began leveraging that into individual buyer and seller services. Over the years, Allen has expanded his portfolio by working with reputable developers, such as Minerva Homes, Cablik Enterprises, Daniel Corporation and Jamestown, to mention a few. Allen's experience and ever-expanding skill set gives him the tools to assist individual buyers and sellers through the challenging process of buying and selling their home, but also the unique tools to help developers navigate the complexities of new home residential project sales and sales management.

Today, Allen Snow Realty is working with Atlanta Fine Homes Sotheby's International Realty and is continuing to build upon the new energy that has taken the city of Atlanta by storm.`, // AboutMe Detailed Description
